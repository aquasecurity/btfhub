# The following distributions (and versions):
#
# fedora32
# fedora33
# fedora34
# centos8
# bionic
# focal
# debian11
#
# are, now, releasing kernels with BTF support. This means that BTFHUB does not
# need to keep generating BTF files for them, as it won't be needed by eBPF
# CO-RE objects (as they can rely in /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux file).
#
# (https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub/issues/29)
#
# Note: this means that, more and more, BTFHUB will be used for legacy kernels:
# the kernels that were already released, part of older (but, yet, current)
# distributions versions.
